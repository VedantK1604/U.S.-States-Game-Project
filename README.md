# U.S.-States-Game-Project
I created a game project using python turtle and the pandas library. The U.S. States Game Project is a fun and educational interactive project that helps users learn about the 50 states of the United States. The goal of the project is to create an engaging and informative game where players can test their knowledge of the states.
